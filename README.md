# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

## Info

### Overview

This app is designed to help students study according to the Pomodoro Technique which dictates that studying should be broken into "focus" and "break" times, typically 25 minutes and 5-10 minutes, respectively.

### Functionality

\+ and - buttons allow users to change focus/break durations.  On play, a session will begin.  The timer will begin to count down, and the buttons to increase/decrease durations will be disabled.  Once the timer hits 0, a sound will play and the break will automatically begin.

### Future Implementation:

Future implementation may include more styling and changing the sound effect to be less intrusive/jarring.  There are no plans to change basic functionality since the app already fulfils its purpose.
